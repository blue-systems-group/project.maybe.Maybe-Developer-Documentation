# Maybe Project

Maybe project let developers be able to defer choices about app behavior that difficult to made at development time.

Maybe project has three components:

[Android Library](android-library)

[Backend Server](backend-server)

[Rewriter](maybe-syntax)

This is a documentation for developers usage only! So it'll lack of some background information.

This documentation is **not completed** because Maybe project is still under development.
