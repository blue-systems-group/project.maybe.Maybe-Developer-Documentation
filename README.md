# Maybe Project
Maybe project lets developers be able to defer choices about app behavior that are difficult to be made at development time.

This is a documentation for **internal developers only**! So it'll lack of some background information.
General introduction of maybe project can be found from [Structuring Uncertainty Using the maybe Statement ](http://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/projects/maybe/)

Maybe project has three components:

[Android Library](android-library/index.html)

[Backend Server](backend-server/index.html)

[Rewriter](maybe-syntax/index.html)

This documentation is **not completed** because Maybe project is still under development.
