# What is debug mode
The debug mode can be used if developers need **manually change** choices in **devices** instead of on Maybe server.

The possible use cases:
* the backend server is not ready
* devices have Internet issue

# How to accomplish
The Maybe library can provides a specific Activity, which include all maybe labels and their choices.
Developers only need a button/link to start the activity.

Because we don't know the UI of developers' app. The developers are the most familiar person who know where to put the button/link is appropriate.

TODO: get all maybe statements and their choices

This is related with Maybe Rewriter and IDE support.
